# Create the html of the final report

I created a make file to complete all tasks, which is named "Makefile". The "Makefile" includes three targets: 
    1. Initial preparation: to unzip the folder "ScientificComputationAssignment67-master.zip" and achieve all needed text files; to copy the needed image file to the current working directory;
    2. Create the markdown file: to convert the needed text files into markdown files and combine them in specific sequences;
    3. Convert the markdown file to html: to produce the website page "finalReport.html" using the markdown file "finalReport.md".

# How to clone the work 

- In my git repository "https://github.com/TongRu3955/PS2705-Assignment7", there is a file "Makefile" which is the make file I used to create the final html as the above steps mentioned.
- To clone the previous work, just need to confirm put the zip folder "ScientificComputationAssignment67-master.zip" and the make file "Makefile" in the same working directory, then run the "make" code in the terminal.

# How to clone the local repo to remote repo

I used the following git commands to upload my local repo to remote repo:
    * git remote add origin https://github.com/TongRu3955/PS2705-Assignment7 (to set the remote url)
    * git remote -v (to confirm the remote url is correct)
    * git
